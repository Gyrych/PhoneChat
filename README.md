# PhoneChat

PhoneChat is a lightweight local web-based chat application that lets users send messages to an external chat API, manage conversations locally, and configure an API key through a settings page.

## Features

- Send and receive messages via the configured external API endpoint (`DEEPSEEK_API_URL`).
- Persist current conversation to `localStorage`.
- Save, load, and delete named conversations.
- Copy and delete individual messages.
- Configure API Key in `config.html` which stores the key in `localStorage`.
 - Organize conversations into groups (folders), rename and move conversations between groups.
 - Automatic generation of conversation summaries (using DeepSeek API) when saving conversations.
 - Aggregated group memory summaries generated by summarizing per-conversation summaries (using DeepSeek API) and injected as system prompts when chatting within the same group.

## Quick Start

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser (no build step required).

## Configuration

- Open `config.html` and paste your DeepSeek API Key, then click “保存设置”. The key is stored in the browser's `localStorage` under `deepseekApiKey`.

## Usage

- Type your message in the input box and press the send button (or press Enter) to send.
- Use the Conversations button to open `conversations.html` for saving or loading conversations.
- Saved conversations are stored in `localStorage` under `savedDeepseekConversations`.

## Files

- `index.html` — Main chat UI and core logic.
- `config.html` — Settings page to store the API Key.
- `conversations.html` — Conversation manager (save/load/delete).
 - `conversations.html` — Conversation manager (save/load/delete), manage groups, view summaries and group memories.
- `style.css` — Styling for the application.
- `script.js` — Small script for navigation buttons.
 - `index.html` — Now renders AI assistant replies as Markdown using `marked` and sanitizes with `DOMPurify` for safety.

## Security Notes

- The API Key is stored in `localStorage` and is not encrypted. For production use, consider using a backend to store keys securely or other secure browser storage approaches.
